# Kite SDK Guide

Kite is a set of libraries, tools, examples, and documentation focused on
making it easier to build applications on top of the Hadoop ecosystem.

This repository contains the Kite SDK Guide.

## Building

### Setup

If you haven't already done so, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your system. You may also
need to install Coderay for syntax highlighting:

```
sudo gem install coderay
```

Then, you can build the current version of the documentation by executing:

```
jekyll build
```

This will compile the documentation into HTML in a directory called \_site.

### Maven content

Some pages depend on documentation generated by maven. To include the content for these pages, run the maven site plugin using:

```
mvn post-site site:stage -DstagingDirectory=/tmp/kite-stage -DtopSiteURL=http://kite-sdk.org
```

Next, link the created docs into the HTML includes folder:

```
ln -s /tmp/kite-stage/docs/<version> _includes/current
```

Pages will be built using content from the staged site when the site is generated.

## Debugging

You can view a live version of the documentation by executing:

```
jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

and then viewing the site at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
